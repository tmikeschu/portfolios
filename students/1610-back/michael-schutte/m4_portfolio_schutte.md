# Mike Schutte - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For my last module at Turing, I want to take my foundational skills to the next level. Specifically, I want to develop a capacity to consider production level factors like scalability and efficiency when developing software. 

I will dive deep into JavaScript and be able to speak to its advantages and disadvantages, and how it compares to Ruby.

I will also keep the job hustle strong throughout the mod. I have a Mod 4 plan that I'll stick to, which includes weekly cold outreach sessions, job applications, and meetup involvement.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Quantified Self Part 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmikeschu/quantified-self-engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self-back-end)

For this continuation part of the project, Robbie and I decided to part ways and work alone. I built API endpoints for foods that can be used by the client-side application from Part 1 (see below). I had a lot of fun learning how server-side apps work under the hood, as the Node-Express process revealed a lot about what Rails does 'for free'.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Quantified Self Part 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/quantified-self)
* [Original
  Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self)

Using only ES6 JavaScript and pure OO design, Robbie Smith and I built a
client-side calorie tracker. Users can CRUD foods, and add them to meals for a
given day.

Evaluation Notes:

- Edit and Delete functionality is buggy in manage foods view
- Calories are not totaling up
- No day totals
- No sorting
- The functionality that is completed is working great, minus a couple bugs
- Great test coverage
- Lot's of JS, well divided and well named. Well done.
- Good conversation in PRs
- Nice work with Tracker.
- Great job on the double challenge. I hope you guys know how much experience
  you got this week. You're in a great place to continue mastering JavaScript.
  I'm assuming with the low Spec Adherence score, you'd just like to take the
  points there.


## Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Specification Adherence

- **1: Application is missing a significant portion of functionality**

### Testing

- **3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and
  integration tests.**

### HTML/UI

- **3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab
  case.**

### JS syntax and Style

- **4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest),
  demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when
  appropriate**

### Git Workflow

- **4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each
  card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and
  conversation**

### Project Management

- **3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.
  Nearly every card has been turned into user stories.**

### Risk Taking

Adhering to any of these additional specifications will allow you to increase
one score above:

- **All functionality is part of a class, written using ES6**
- **No Libraries (except for testing). All JavaScript functionality is your
  own.**

Feedback to me:

From Robbie Smith: I enjoyed working with Schutte on part one of the Quantified Self project. He picks up concepts pretty dang quick, and I appreciated his patience and willingness to help me understand.

## D: Professional Skills (Intro)

### Gear Up 

#### Automation Planning Part 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmikeschu/gear-up/tree/master/m4_sessions)

We spent time reading through the survey results. Our group consensus was to
facilitate a forced debate, with sides for and against automation. I'm excited
for the opportunity to iterate on and lead a GearUp session.

#### Automation Planning Part 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmikeschu/gear-up/blob/20e70774ebae8e4a13c989e9d1daa9db57af4c86/m4_sessions/automation/session_one/one_elijah_annie_schutte_devin.md)

We spend a lot of time researching other articles that show a more negative side
of automation, based on requests from the survey results. Time flew pretty
quickly, and we put together a basic outline for the GearUp that we'll lead.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Robbie Smith: I really enjoyed working with you on Part 1 of Quantified Self.
I was a little hesitant to take on all the challenges that you were keen to, but
I'm super glad you pushed us to not use jQuery. I really respect your drive to
learn things deeply and understand what's going on. At the same time, I think
that need to understand everything can sometimes slow down productivity. My only
suggestion for future projects is to reflect on what is essential to know, and
what can be figured out at a later time. Thanks again for being such a solid
partner during our endeavors into the painfully wordy world of Vanilla
JavaScript.

### Being a Community Member

From Laszlo Balogh: Schutteâ€™s spike session has been awesome for so many
reasons. It is very well structured, Schutte does an excellent job of
presenting the content, keep the audience engaged and mixing up live coding and
talking through slides.  Very motivating and the audience was completely
engaged and active during the entire session.  Excellent job and thank you for
the effort to introduce importance of testing to a larger audience.

### Playing a Part

* Led a Friday Spike on Dream Driven Development. Gave this talk at the March
  Denver.rb Meetup.

* Delivered a lightning talk at Wrap Up about CSS flexbox styling. Also gave a
  longer version of this talk at the March HTML5 Meetup.

* Paired with students from Mods 1 and 2.
